# Bharath Vani - Indian Languages Knowledge Portal

## Overview

Bharath Vani is a comprehensive knowledge portal that enables communication across multiple Indian languages. It helps people access information, educational services, and resources in their preferred language, making knowledge more accessible to speakers of India's diverse linguistic communities.

The platform is particularly valuable for students in educational settings. When lessons are delivered in a student's primary language, they can learn and understand information far more effectively than if lessons were conducted solely in English or Hindi. Bharath Vani recognises that language is fundamental to learning and understanding.

### Our Mission

Bharath Vani exists to assist Indians who struggle to access information, educational services, or other resources in their native languages. We believe that no Indian should be left behind because of language barriers.

## Important Note: What We Don't Do

It's important to understand what Bharath Vani is not:

- We are not a real-time translation service like Google Translate
- We do not offer instant speech-to-text or voice translation
- We are not an artificial intelligence language model
- We do not replace the need to learn new languages

If you're looking for real-time AI translation services, you may want to explore Bhashini, which is a separate government initiative focused on machine translation.

Bharath Vani is fundamentally a knowledge portal and resource library, not a translation or AI platform.
