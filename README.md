# Bharath Vaani - Speech Recognition & Translation Web App

## What is Bharath Vaani?

Bharath Vaani is a modern web application that lets you speak, converts your speech to text, and then translates it into multiple languages. It's a handy tool if you need to communicate across language barriers using just your voice and a browser.

Think of it as a voice-to-text translator that works right in your web browser. You speak, it listens, transcribes what you've said, and can translate the output into dozens of languages.

## What's Under the Hood?

This is a modern web application, likely built using React or Next.js and hosted on Vercel (a popular platform for modern web apps).

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:** React or Next.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Voice Recognition:** Uses the Web Speech API - a browser feature that lets websites access your microphone and convert speech to text without needing complicated server-side setup.

**Translation:** Probably connected to a translation service (could be Google Translate API, Microsoft Translator, Hugging Face, or another service). Exact details aren't publicly disclosed.

**Hosting:** Vercel, which is built for modern JavaScript applications.

## Important Notes

This is **not** an official government project. It's a third-party web application, likely created as a demonstration or practical tool using publicly available APIs.

It's **not** part of the official Bharatavani portal or government language initiatives. It's a separate project.

The exact translation service used isn't documented publicly, so you might want to test it yourself to see which languages work best for your needs.

## Who Would Find This Useful?

- **Language learners** - Practice speaking and see your words translated.
- **Business professionals** - Quick translations during meetings or calls.
- **Accessibility** - For people who prefer voice input over typing.
- **Content creators** - Transcribe spoken content quickly.
- **Non-native speakers** - Communicate across language barriers without typing.
- **Teachers and students** - For classroom activities in multilingual settings.

## Getting Started

Visit the web app here: [bharat-vaani-six.vercel.app](https://bharat-vaani-six.vercel.app/)

No installation needed. Just:
1. Open the link in your browser
2. Allow microphone access when prompted
3. Select your language and start speaking

---

## Technical Details

Because this is hosted on Vercel and uses web standards like the Web Speech API, it's designed to work smoothly on modern browsers. The application runs mostly in your browser, with translation happening via API calls to translation services.

The code is likely JavaScript-based, using React for the user interface and various APIs for voice and translation functionality.

---

## Limitations & Considerations

- Works best with clear speech and good microphone input
- Internet connection required for translation services
- Accuracy depends on pronunciation and background noise
- Translation quality varies depending on language pairs
- Not an official or government-backed service

---

## What This Is NOT

This is not the official Bharatavani government language portal (bharatavani.in). This is a separate, independent web tool.

It's not a comprehensive language learning platform. It's focused on speech-to-text and translation, not teaching grammar or building vocabulary.

It's not designed for real-time conversation between two people. It's a one-way tool for transcribing and translating what you say.

---

## Try It Out

If you need a quick way to transcribe your voice in Indian languages and translate the text, this tool is worth trying. It's straightforward, requires no setup, and works entirely in your browser.

Visit [bharat-vaani-six.vercel.app](https://bharat-vaani-six.vercel.app/) to give it a go.
